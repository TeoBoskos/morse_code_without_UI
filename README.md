# Morse Code Translator Using Python.

# This small program requires some text input and converts it to morse code, which is the output.

Before saying anything, I want to say that when I worked on this project, I was relatively new to Python.
So, this small project took me 2 days to complete, and it is a functioning text to morse code translator.
However, there is no GUI, and I am currently working on it. I might update this repository, or create
a new one all together.

# Found a bug or a flaw in my code?

Since this project is not made to help anyone ( it was just for practice and fun ) and also since I am
relatively new to Python, know that I am open to criticism that is going to help me become a better coder.
